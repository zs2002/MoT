## This Project is meant for MoT competition.
Here you will find:

##### Point #1,2 will be sent individually due to privacy and legal terms.

#### 1- Meta data.
#### 2- Datset.
#### 3- Our solution.
#### 4- Any other open and public datasets which support the objective.

### looking for :
#### population data

##### collected Inspiration from Kaggle:
###### * How has changing traffic flow impacted accidents?
###### * Can we predict accident rates over time? What might improve accident rates?
###### * Plot interactive maps of changing trends, e.g. How has Riyadh has changed for cyclists? Busiest roads in the nation?
###### * Which areas never change and why? Identify infrastructure needs, failings and successes.
###### * How have Rural and Urban areas differed (see RoadCategory)? How about the differences between Saudi cities?
###### * The MoT gov. also like to look at miles driven. You can do this by multiplying the AADF by the corresponding length of road (link length) and by the number of days in the years. What does this tell you about Saudi roads?
###### ---
###### * combined with population data, how do different areas compare?
###### * what trends are there for accidents involving different road users eg motorcycles, peds, cyclists
###### * are road safety campaigns effective?
###### * likelihood of accidents for different groups / vehicles 
###### * many more
